## How does it work?

There are 8 variables used to calculate the Carbon Footprint of a person inside the application: 

* Monthly Electric Bill (dollars)
* Monthly Gas Bill (dollars)
* Monthly Oil Bill (dollars)
* Total yearly mileage on the car (miles)
* Number of short flights (less than 4 hours long) taken in the past year (number)
* Number of long flights (more than 4 hours long) taken in the past year (number)
* Recicles Newspapers (boolean)
* Recicles Aluminuim (boolean)

## How to run the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
